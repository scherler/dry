# DRY
Don't repeat yourself - components that can be used anywhere

## Why?
Who spents more than 50% of their development time to create base components in her/his projects to fit the needs of design (which needs to sign them off)? Who wrote or witnessed the creation of more than one design framework or component libary in their work? 

Well, I did. 

I think it is a waste of resources due to a lack of cordinationa and coporation. However, there is not much to do to enhance that in a work if you are a simple worker bee.
